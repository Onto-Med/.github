## üôã‚Äç What is the Onto-Med Research Group?
The *Onto-Med Research Group* conducts basic research in formal ontology, designs formal tools for constructing and managing ontologies
and develops top level ontologies as well as domain and core ontologies for medicine, bio-medicine and biology, but also for other fields.
The Onto-Med group uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining methods from logic, computer science, philosophy and cognitive linguistics.

The Onto-Med group considers *Formal Ontology* as an evolving science which is concerned with systematically developing axiomatic theories
that describe forms, structures, and modes of being at different levels of abstraction and granularity. The roots of formal ontology
can be traced back to the philosophical investigations of *Aristotle* and *Plato*. Their work was creatively enriched during the early
Middle Ages by Islamic philosophers, including *Avicenna*, renowned as one of the history's greatest thinkers and medical scholars.

The *Onto-Med Research Group* was founded in 2002 and is a result of a collaboration between the
[Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics, and Epidemiology (IMISE)](https://www.imise.uni-leipzig.de/en), [Leipzig University](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/en),
and the [Department of Formal Concepts at the Institute for Informatics (IfI)](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/fk/), [Leipzig University](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/en).

## üßô Research
The research is divided in three stages: *Foundational Research*, *Methodological Research*, and *Applications*. The foundational research is
devoted to *formal ontology* and *applied logic*, the methodological research includes the development of *conceptual tools* for
*building and representing of ontologies*. The applications are aimed at the development of *domain and core ontologies* and of *software systems*.

The main concern of **formal ontology** is the development and the analysis foundational ontologies and their integration into a unified system.
This research draws on philosophy, cognitive science and linguistics. **Applied logic** is aimed at the formalization of ontologically basic
categories and relations and at meta-logical investigations of axiomatic theories.

**Methodological research** is directed at principles of conceptual modelling, meta-ontological principles, and ontology architectures.
Further methodological topics pertain to the structure, definition and specification of categories and to ontology languages.

**Applications** include the development of domain and core ontologies in the areas of medicine, bio-medicine and life sciences,
but also in other areas. Computer-based applications are aimed at the development of software in support of clinical trials,
of building and managing of ontologies, and of health care. See our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Onto-Med/repositories)
for more information about currently available computer-based applications.
